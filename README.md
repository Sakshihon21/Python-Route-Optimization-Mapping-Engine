🗺️ Python Route Optimization & Mapping Engine

A powerful Python-based Route Planning and Optimization System that uses OSMNx, NetworkX, and OpenStreetMap to compute the shortest and most optimized driving route between any two real-world locations.
The system automatically geocodes place names, extracts road networks, computes the shortest path using graph algorithms, and generates an interactive map or a saved map image as output.

🚀 Features

✔ Geocode any real-world location (city, village, landmarks, etc.)
✔ Fetch live road network using OpenStreetMap
✔ Compute shortest route using NetworkX (Dijkstra / A*)
✔ Visualize route on an interactive map
✔ Save route as an image or HTML
✔ Accurate and smooth route plotting using OSMNx edge geometry
✔ Works for long-distance routes (multiple city-to-city inputs)

📦 Technologies Used

Python 3

OSMNx (for map + graph data)

NetworkX (shortest path algorithms)

Geopy (geocoding using Nominatim)

Matplotlib (saving route as an image)

Folium (for interactive map, optional)
